GLaDOS RetroFE Theme
----------------------------------------------------------

A unified RetroFE theme.

The idea behind this theme is to provide a unified look across the entire setup, which lights up when media is available but is completely usable when it isn't. The theme shows a system image, manufacturer logo, year and system type on the main menu, and box art, cart art, rating and genre on the sub menu. It uses a logo based wheel, which simply shows text when no logo is available.

SETUP / DOWNLOADS
----------------------------------------------------------

- Github

- Latest Release (v1.0)
https://github.com/nicktones/GLaDOS-16x9/archive/v1.0.zip

- Collections
This is a set of over 180 RetroFE collections, each with the system type, manufacturer and year included.  Either copy the three lines containing the manufacturer, year and type from settings.conf and paste into your existing collection or just use these collections.  If you use these collections you will need to set the rom and media paths accordingly.
This batch find and replace tool is useful for setting paths in multiple collections in one go - https://findandreplace.codeplex.com

Coming soon...

- Manufacturer Logos
This is an updated set of manufacturer logos, from those included with the RetroFE release.  This is not yet complete, and logos aren't as high a quality as they could be - please post if you have better versions of these logos.  Add these to retrofe\collections\_common\medium_artwork\manufacturer

Coming soon...

- System Stories & Device Images
This is collection of system device images, along with a story file for each system.  The device image and the story text files are all in system sub folders and are named device.png and story.txt for drop in use with RetroFE.  Mostly speaking the story files are the first couple of paragraphs from wikipedia, other sources were also used.
So far there are 120 story files completed, and the rest are being worked on.  System images aren't complete, again please post if you have better examples or missing images.

I personally have these in my Media folder - Media\System Images\<system_name> - you will need to update the collection settings.conf option, media.system_artwork.  It seems RetroFE looks in this place for system images and system story files - provided they are named story.txt and device.png. Again, the batch file and replace tool mentioned above is useful for mass editing collection options.

Coming soon...
